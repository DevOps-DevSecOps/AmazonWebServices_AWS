[Volumes]
Creating a Volume it should be with in Availability Zone (AZ).
We can build the Volume to Snapshot, Snapshot Lifecycle Manager.
Types :
● Solid State Drives (SSD)
-> General Purpose SSD — Provides a balance of price and performance. We recommend these volumes for most workloads.
Volume type = gp2 & gp3
Use cases = Low-latency interactive apps, Development and Test environments
Volume size = 1 GiB - 16 TiB
Amazon EBS Multi-attach = Not supported
Boot volume = Supported
-> Provisioned IOPS SSD — Provides high performance for mission-critical, low-latency, or high-throughput workloads.
Volume type = io1 & io2 
Use cases = Highest-performance SSD volume, high-throughput applications, used for large databases
Volume size = 4 GiB - 16 TiB
Amazon EBS Multi-attach = Supported
Boot volume = Supported
● Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
-> Throughput Optimized HDD — A low-cost HDD designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads.
Volume type = st1
Use cases = Big data, Data warehouses, Log processing
Volume size = 125 GiB - 16 TiB
Amazon EBS Multi-attach = Not supported
Boot volume = Not supported
-> Cold HDD — The lowest-cost HDD design for less frequently accessed workloads.
Volume type = sc1
Use cases = infrequently accessed data, Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important
Volume size = 125 GiB - 16 TiB
Amazon EBS Multi-attach = Not supported
Boot volume = Not supported
● Magnetic
Volume type = standard
Use cases = Workloads where data is infrequently accessed
Volume size = 1 GiB - 1 TiB
Boot volume = Supported

[Snapshots]
We can create Snapshot from Volume, Instance.
We can copy the Snapshot across the region.
We can build the Snapshot to AMI.
We can build the Snapshot to Volume with in Availability Zone (AZ).

[Lifecycle Manager]
We can create Snapshot from Volume, Instance.
We can copy the Snapshot across the region using Cross-Region copy.
