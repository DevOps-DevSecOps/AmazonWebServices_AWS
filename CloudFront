Is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from AWS which delivers content from origin location to edge location (AWS CDN Datacenter).
Where is only use for caching the Data.
Edge location allow the caching of static objects from the origin location, The origin can be as S3 Bucket, ELB, EC2, Route 53, ...etc which distributes traffic among origin Instances.
User experience will be increased as the latency will be decreased and also content load time.
Edge Location - It the location where content will be cached, it separate an across Region/AZ (Edge location is not an AWS Region).
				It not just READ only - can write to them i.e.. PUT an object onto them. 
				It utilised by S3 Transfer Acceleration to reduce latency for S3 upload.
Origin - The origin of all file CDN will distribute. This includes like S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance, ELB, Route 53.
Distribution - CDN which consist of a collection of Edge Locations that provide Low-Latency and high data transfer speeds.
			   There will be 2 types.
			   ● Web - used for Websites.
			   ● RTMP - used for Media Streaming.
Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live).

Its very 1st time Users try to access server will be high latency and data transfer speed will be low and it will cache the data at Edge Location.
Then later 2nd time Users try to access server will be low latency and high data transfer speed and from the Edge Location get response immediately.
